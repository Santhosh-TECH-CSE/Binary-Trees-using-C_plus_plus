PROBLEM DESCRIPTION :----

Given the root of a binary tree, return the length of the diameter of the tree.

The diameter of a binary tree is the length of the longest path between any two nodes in a tree. This path may or may not pass through the root.

The length of a path between two nodes is represented by the number of edges between them.

MY STRATERGY :--

IF I AT ONE NODE, SO HERE I WILL CALCULATE THE HIEGHT OF LEFT AND RIGHT SUB-TREES OF THAT NODE
BY ADDING IT I WILL STORE THE VALUE IN A VARIABLE AND I KEEP ON DOING FOR ALL THE NODES AND AT LAST I WILL RETURN THE MAX VALUE OF THE DIAMETER


CODE :---

class Solution {
public:
    int diameterOfBinaryTree(TreeNode* root) {
        int maxDiameter = 0;
        depth(root, maxDiameter);
        return maxDiameter;
    }
    
private:
    int depth(TreeNode* node, int& maxDiameter) {
        if (!node) return 0;
        int leftDepth = depth(node->left, maxDiameter);
        int rightDepth = depth(node->right, maxDiameter);
        maxDiameter = max(maxDiameter, leftDepth + rightDepth);
        return 1 + max(leftDepth, rightDepth);
    }
};
